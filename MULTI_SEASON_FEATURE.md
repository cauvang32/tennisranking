# Multi-Season Concurrent Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This feature allows multiple tennis seasons to run concurrently, with automatic end date functionality and season selection when creating/editing matches.

## Key Features

### 1. **Concurrent Active Seasons**
- Multiple seasons can be active simultaneously
- No automatic ending of previous seasons when creating new ones
- Each season operates independently

### 2. **Auto-End Functionality**
- Seasons can be configured to automatically end on a specific date
- Optional feature controlled by `auto_end` checkbox in season creation/edit
- Requires an end date to be set
- Backend checks and ends expired seasons automatically

### 3. **Season Selection in Matches**
- Match creation form now includes a season selector dropdown
- Shows only active seasons
- Displays end dates for context
- Auto-selects when only one active season exists
- Required field - prevents match creation without season selection

### 4. **Enhanced Season Management UI**
- Shows count of concurrent active seasons
- Displays season descriptions
- Shows auto-end status
- Shows ended date and who ended it
- Visual indicators for active seasons

## Database Changes

### Seasons Table (New Columns)
```sql
- auto_end: BOOLEAN (default false) - Whether season auto-ends on end_date
- description: TEXT (nullable) - Optional season description
- ended_at: TIMESTAMP (nullable) - When season was ended
- ended_by: VARCHAR(255) (nullable) - Username who ended the season
```

## Backend Changes

### Database Layer (`database-postgresql.js`)

#### Modified Methods:
1. **`getActiveSeasons()`**
   - Now returns ALL active seasons (array)
   - Previously returned only the first one

2. **`createSeason(name, startDate, endDate, autoEnd, description)`**
   - Added `autoEnd` parameter
   - Added `description` parameter
   - Supports auto-end configuration

3. **`updateSeason(seasonId, name, startDate, endDate, autoEnd, description)`**
   - Added `autoEnd` parameter
   - Added `description` parameter
   - Can update all season fields

4. **`endSeason(seasonId, endDate, endedBy)`**
   - Now accepts optional `endDate` (defaults to today)
   - Tracks `endedBy` username

#### New Methods:
5. **`checkAndEndExpiredSeasons()`**
   - Automatically ends seasons where:
     - `auto_end = true`
     - `end_date <= today`
     - `is_active = true`
   - Returns count of ended seasons

### Server API (`server.js`)

#### Modified Endpoints:
1. **`GET /api/seasons/active`** (BREAKING CHANGE)
   - Now returns **array** of active seasons
   - Previously returned single object
   - Public access

2. **`GET /api/seasons/active-one`** (NEW - Backward Compatibility)
   - Returns first active season as single object
   - For backward compatibility

3. **`POST /api/seasons`** (Admin only)
   - Now accepts: `endDate`, `autoEnd`, `description`
   - Calls `checkAndEndExpiredSeasons()` before creating
   - Validates auto-end requires end date
   - Validates end date is after start date

4. **`PUT /api/seasons/:id`** (Admin only)
   - Now updates: `autoEnd`, `description`
   - Same validation as POST

5. **`POST /api/seasons/:id/end`** (Admin/Editor)
   - Now accepts optional `endDate` in request body
   - Defaults to today if not provided
   - Tracks `endedBy` from `req.user.username`

#### New Endpoints:
6. **`POST /api/seasons/check-expired`** (Admin only)
   - Manually triggers check for expired seasons
   - Returns count of seasons ended
   - Useful for testing or manual maintenance

## Frontend Changes

### HTML (`index.html`)
- Added season selector dropdown to match form
- Placed in form-row with date field for side-by-side display

   - Called after loading seasons

#### Modified Methods:
2. **`loadSeasons()`**
   - Now calls `updateSeasonSelect()` after loading data

3. **`recordMatch()`**
   - Removed auto-selection of first active season
   - Now reads from `matchSeason` dropdown
   - Added validation for season selection
   - Passes `seasonId` from user selection

4. **`renderSeasons()`**
   - Shows count of concurrent active seasons
   - Displays season descriptions
   - Shows auto-end indicator

## Usage Guide

### Creating Concurrent Seasons

1. **Navigate to Seasons tab**
2. **Click "Tạo mùa giải" button**
3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Season name (required)
   - Description (optional) - describe the season purpose
   - Start date (required)
   - End date (optional) - when season should end
   - Auto-end checkbox (optional) - check to auto-end on end date

4. **Scenarios:**

   **Scenario A: Indefinite Season**
   - Set name and start date only
   - Leave end date empty
   - Season runs until manually ended

   **Scenario B: Fixed Duration with Manual End**
   - Set name, start date, and end date
   - Leave auto-end unchecked
   - Season can be manually ended anytime, shows planned end date

   **Scenario C: Auto-Ending Season**
   - Set name, start date, and end date
   - Check auto-end checkbox
   - Season automatically ends on end date

### Creating Matches with Multiple Seasons

1. **Navigate to Matches tab**
2. **Select match date**
3. **Select season from dropdown**
   - Only active seasons are shown
   - End dates displayed for reference
   - Auto-selected if only one active season
4. **Fill in players and scores as usual**

### Viewing Concurrent Seasons

- Seasons tab shows all seasons
- Info banner shows count of active concurrent seasons
- Active seasons highlighted in green
- Auto-end status shown next to end date
- Description shown if provided

### Auto-End Behavior

- Backend checks for expired seasons:
  - On application startup
  - When creating new seasons
  - When manually triggered via API

- Seasons are auto-ended when:
  - `auto_end = true`
  - Current date >= `end_date`
  - Season is still active

- Auto-ended seasons:
  - Set `is_active = false`
  - Set `ended_at = end_date`
  - Set `ended_by = 'system'`

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ **API Breaking Change**: `GET /api/seasons/active` now returns an array instead of a single object.

**Migration Path:**
- Use `GET /api/seasons/active-one` for backward compatibility (returns first active season)
- Update any external integrations to handle array response
- Frontend already updated to handle multiple seasons

### Database Migration
✅ **No migration script required** - Database changes handled automatically by:
- PostgreSQL allows adding nullable columns
- New columns have sensible defaults (`auto_end = false`)
- Existing data remains valid

### Existing Data Compatibility
✅ All existing data remains functional:
- Existing seasons work without end dates
- Existing matches don't require season selector changes
- Existing rankings and statistics unchanged

## Testing Checklist

### Season Management
- [ ] Create season without end date (indefinite)
- [ ] Create season with end date but no auto-end
- [ ] Create season with end date and auto-end enabled
- [ ] Create multiple concurrent active seasons
- [ ] Edit season to add/remove auto-end
- [ ] Edit season to change end date
- [ ] Manually end a season
- [ ] Verify auto-end works on configured date

### Match Creation
- [ ] Create match with only one active season (auto-select)
- [ ] Create match with multiple active seasons (manual select)
- [ ] Verify match creation fails without season selection
- [ ] Edit existing match and change season
- [ ] Verify season dropdown shows only active seasons

### UI Display
- [ ] Verify concurrent season count shows correctly
- [ ] Verify season descriptions display
- [ ] Verify auto-end indicator shows
- [ ] Verify ended date displays
- [ ] Verify responsive layout works

### Backend
- [ ] Test `POST /api/seasons/check-expired` endpoint
- [ ] Verify expired seasons auto-end at midnight
- [ ] Verify ended_by tracking works
- [ ] Verify validation prevents invalid data

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
None required - feature works with existing configuration.

### Feature Flags (Optional)
To disable concurrent seasons (force single active season):
- Add validation in `POST /api/seasons` endpoint
- Check for existing active season before allowing create
- This is NOT implemented by default

## Performance Considerations

### Database Impact
- Minimal: Only 4 new columns added
- Indexed `is_active` column already exists
- Auto-end check is lightweight (single query)

### Frontend Impact
- Season dropdown populated once per page load
- No continuous polling required
- Auto-end handled server-side

### Recommended Monitoring
- Track number of concurrent active seasons
- Monitor auto-end execution logs
- Alert if more than expected concurrent seasons

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Scheduled Auto-End Jobs**
   - Use cron job instead of on-demand checks
   - More predictable timing
   - Lower overhead

2. **Season Templates**
   - Save season configurations as templates
   - Quick creation of similar seasons

3. **Season Overlapping Rules**
   - Optional validation to prevent date overlaps
   - Warning when creating overlapping seasons

4. **Season Statistics Dashboard**
   - Compare statistics across concurrent seasons
   - Visualize season timelines

5. **Season Archiving**
   - Archive old seasons after certain period
   - Keep database lean

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Season selector is empty**
- **Cause**: No active seasons exist
- **Solution**: Create at least one active season

**Issue: Match creation fails with season error**
- **Cause**: Selected season became inactive
- **Solution**: Refresh page to update season list

**Issue: Auto-end not working**
- **Cause**: Server not running check job
- **Solution**: Call `POST /api/seasons/check-expired` manually or restart server

**Issue: Can't create season with auto-end**
- **Cause**: End date not provided
- **Solution**: Set end date before enabling auto-end

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in `server.js`:
```javascript
// Add at top of checkAndEndExpiredSeasons calls
console.log('Checking for expired seasons...')
```

### Rollback Procedure
If issues arise:
1. Disable auto-end on all seasons via database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE seasons SET auto_end = false WHERE auto_end = true;
   ```
2. Remove season selector from match form (revert HTML change)
3. Revert `recordMatch()` to auto-select first active season
