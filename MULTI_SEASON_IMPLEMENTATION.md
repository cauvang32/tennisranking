## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Creating Seasons

#### Season with Auto-End:
```javascript
{
  "name": "Summer Tournament 2025",
  "description": "Annual summer championship",
  "startDate": "2025-06-01",
  "endDate": "2025-08-31",      // Required for auto-end
  "autoEnd": true                // Will end automatically
}
```

#### Season without End Date (Manual End Required):
```javascript
{
  "name": "Ongoing League",
  "description": "Continuous league play",
  "startDate": "2025-01-01",
  "endDate": null,               // No end date
  "autoEnd": false               // Must end manually
}
```

### Recording Matches

When creating/editing a match, users must now select which season:

```javascript
{
  "seasonId": 1,                 // User-selected season
  "playDate": "2025-10-03",
  "player1Id": 1,
  "player2Id": 2,
  // ... other match data
}
```

### Ending Seasons

**Manual End:**
- Click "🏁 Kết thúc" button on any active season
- System records current user and timestamp
- Season becomes inactive

**Automatic End:**
- Seasons with `auto_end=true` and `end_date` set
- System checks daily and ends expired seasons
- Can also trigger via: `POST /api/seasons/check-expired`

### Reactivating Seasons

- Click "✅ Kích hoạt lại" button on any ended season
- Season becomes active again
- `ended_at` and `ended_by` are cleared
- Can record new matches for this season

## 🔍 Current Database State

Your existing seasons:

```sql
 id |      name      | start_date |  end_date  | is_active | auto_end 
----+----------------+------------+------------+-----------+----------
  1 | Wimbledon 2025 | 2025-06-29 | 2025-09-08 | t         | f
  2 | 222            | 2025-09-09 | NULL       | t         | f        ← No end date
  3 | 1232           | 2025-10-15 | 2025-10-25 | t         | f
```

**Note**: Season "222" has no end date, so it requires manual ending.
