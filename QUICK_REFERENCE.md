## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
seasons table:
├── id (PK)
├── name
├── start_date
├── end_date          ← NOW OPTIONAL (can be NULL)
├── is_active
├── created_at
├── auto_end          ← NEW

## 🎯 Key Points

✅ **end_date is optional** - Can be NULL for seasons without fixed end date

✅ **Multiple active seasons** - Can have many active seasons simultaneously

✅ **Auto-end requires end_date** - If auto_end=true, must set end_date

✅ **Manual end always works** - Can end any season manually anytime

✅ **Reactivate anytime** - Can bring back any ended season

✅ **Full audit trail** - Tracks who ended season and when
