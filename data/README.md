# 📁 Data Folder

This folder stores all the shared Excel data files for the Tennis Ranking System.

## 🎯 Purpose
- **Shared Data Storage**: All users access the same data files from here
- **Automatic Backups**: System automatically saves timestamped Excel files
- **Version History**: Keep multiple versions of your data with timestamps

## 📋 File Naming Convention
Files are saved with timestamps for easy identification:
- `tennis-data_2024-06-23_14-30.xlsx` - Data saved on June 23, 2024 at 2:30 PM
- Most recent file is automatically loaded when users access the system

## 🔄 How It Works
1. **Auto-Save**: Every time someone adds players or records matches, data is automatically saved here
2. **Auto-Load**: When users open the system, it loads the most recent file automatically  
3. **Shared Access**: All users see the same data - perfect for tournament management!

## 💾 Backup Strategy
- **Automatic**: System creates timestamped backups on every save
- **Manual**: Users can still export additional Excel files if needed
- **Recovery**: If something goes wrong, older files are available here

## 🚨 Important Notes
- **Don't manually delete files** unless you're sure you don't need them
- **Files grow with data** - more matches = larger files
- **Keep this folder** - it's essential for the shared system to work
